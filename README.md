Another Common Lisp geometry library

This library is an almost direct translation of wonderful Javascript libraries, found on http://www.kevlindev.com by Kevin Lindsey.

It has classes for 2D point, 2D vector and number of routines for calculating shapes intersection.

One day it will contain full list of routines translated, but right now it has routines for line-line intersection and line-Bezier intersection.
These routines returns two values: are there intersections exist and what points of intersections are.
